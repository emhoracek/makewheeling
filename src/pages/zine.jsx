        <h2>Call for Submissions</h2>
        <p>
          <cite>Rust &amp; Rebirth: Visions of a Solarpunk Wheeling</cite> is seeking submissions of art, short essays, and microfiction for a zine envisioning an ecologically sustainable future for Wheeling.

        <h2>Why solarpunk?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes it seems like the world around us is only getting worse all the time. The future looks like more of the same, or worse, a slow decay into desperation and disaster. It can be hard to even conceive of a way we could turn things around.</p>

        <p>Solarpunk is a visual and literary aesthetic that challenges us to stretch our imaginations and move beyond what seems practical or politically feasible in the here and now, to consider a future world we actually want to live in. That world will not be perfect - no matter what, climate change is happening - but we will figure out ways to adapt and become more sustainable. In some ways, humanity's future might even be better than life today.</p>

        <p>Imagination is important - if we can imagine this future when all our effort is worth it, that can give us the energy and conviction we need to make vital changes today. So what does a solarpunk future look like for Wheeling?</p>
